### Pain Points Section

**Badge:** Sound Familiar?

**Headline:** The Content Chaos Problem

**Description:** Managing SEO content at scale is broken. As your content library grows, so does the chaos.

**Pain Point 1 - Spreadsheet Hell:**
100+ row spreadsheets become unnavigable. Version conflicts. No one can visualize how articles relate to each other.

**Pain Point 2 - Blind Writing:**
Writers create content without real-time feedback. Issues discovered post-writing require painful rewrites.

**Pain Point 3 - Invisible Link Structure:**
Links are buried inside content. No way to visualize the link graph. Orphan pages go unnoticed.

**Pain Point 4 - Disconnected Workflows:**
Strategy in spreadsheets, content in CMS. No connection between the plan and reality. Strategy becomes outdated.

**Pain Point 5 - Client Communication Gaps:**
Sending Word docs lacks professionalism. Clients can't see SEO efforts. Approval workflows involve messy email chains.

**Pain Point 6 - The Real Cost:**
Hours wasted, costly rewrites, weak topical authority, lost clients, and missed rankings. There's a better way.
